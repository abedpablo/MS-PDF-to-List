# MS-PDF-to-List
MS compound optimization data to dataframe built with Python 2.7

The Advanced Clinical Chemistry Diagnostic Laboratory specializes in developing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods for the detection and quantification of small molecules in a variety of matrices. Early in method development, reference compounds are infused, or injected, to the mass spectrometer (MS) to optimize MS parameters for the compound(s) of interest. In most recent iterations of MS software, the output is placed into a PDF. In our most recent assay development, we infused over 50 compounds. This script parsed through the PDF files and compiled the data and placed it into the a CSV file that could be used to build the instrument method.
